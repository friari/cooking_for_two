Planning
****************************
After iterating through a couple ideas in a brainstorm,
![a relative link](docs/brainstorm.jpg)
We decided to work on an app that draws on a database of recipes and outputs a recipe that will be suitable for the user.
Initially we thought it might be nice if the app starts by asking the user how many people they are cooking for
![a relative link](docs/how_many_people.jpg)
but then we decided that since we only have two days to create this app it would be necessary to simplify the concept. We did so by deciding the app would be for people who are cooking for a date.

The name "Cooking For Two" emerged naturally from this process, and we drew up a rough flow chart indicating how the app would run.

After we had our rough idea, we wrote three user stories. These can be seen on our trello board but are also attached below.

The user stories helped focus our idea, and we created a flow chart as the basis for our app.

After this, we sourced recipes from the internet

Our aim is to ultimately include the recipes into different hashes for each branch. This is how we envisioned it.

As all this was happening, we were uploading our plans to a shared Trello board we created
![a relative link](docs/trello.jpg)

as well as keeping up constant communication via Slack.

As Ari worked on the Description and Planning section of our README.md file, Alex put together a .rb doc that defined a Cookbook class.

Ari then coded a doc that referenced the Cookbook class and created objects for each potential outcome as Alex worked on the control flow of the program.
